1. The source IP address is 192.168.4.27 and its port number is 60268

3. --
4. The relative sequence number of the initial TCP segment is 0. The raw sequence number is 378842094. It is identified as a SYN segment because the SYN flag is set.
5. The relative sequence number of the second TCP segment is 0. The raw sequence number is 1147676677. The raw acknowledgment number is 378842094; that is the last received segment's sequence number + 1. It is identified as a SYNACK segment because the SYN and ACK flags are both set.
6. The sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command is 1 (378842095).
7. (Relative) sequence numbers for the first six segments in the TCP connection were: 1, 714, 2162, 3610, 5058, 6506. The times at which those segments were sent were: 3.042440, 3.042623, 3.042623, 3.042624, 3.042625, 3.042626. The times at which those segments were acknowledged were: 3.044654, 3.070550, 3.070556, 3.070557, 3.070557 (cumulative acknowledgment of relative sequence 10850). The RTT values (acknowledgment time - sent time) for each segment were: 0.002214, 0.027927, 0.027933, 0.027933, 0.027932, 0.027931. The running `EstimatedRTT` for each segment (assuming `EstimatedRTT` = measured RTT for the first segment) is given by the formula `EstimatedRTT` = (1 - alpha) * `EstimatedRTT` + alpha * SampleRTT, where the recommended value for alpha is 1/8 = 0.125. That yields a running `EstimatedRTT` of: 0.002214, 0.005428, 0.008241, 0.010702, 0.012856, 0.014740.
8. The lengths of each of the first six TCP segments were: 713, 1448, 1448, 1448, 1448, 1448.
9. The minimum amount of buffer space advertised by the receiver is 235. This comes in the first ACK segment from the server after the SYNACK segment in the three-way handshake. This appears to cause throttling on the part of the sender, which had been sending packets at a rate of about one per microsecond. After receiving the ACK with window size 235, the sender stops sending segments until it receives a second ACK ~26 milliseconds later with a calculated window size of 30464. 3 more ACKs are then received within the next 7 microseconds, each one of which further increases the window size, and the sender resumes sending segments about 100 microseconds later at the originally observed rate of about 1/microsecond. Throughout the connection, pauses of 1-15 milliseconds are observed between data segments from the sender and ACK segments from the receiver; in these cases, the sum of bytes sent by the sender between the byte acknowledged by the receiver and the next pause consistently appears to be ~1/2 the size of the receive window specified in the ACK segment. For example, segemnt 147 specifies a window size of 150,008 and acknowledges segment 103. Between segment 103 and the next ACK segment after 147 (segment 167), the sender sends 53 data segments each containing 1448 bytes of data, for a total of 76,744 (~150,008/2). This suggests that the sender is throttling itself to fill just half of the window size.
