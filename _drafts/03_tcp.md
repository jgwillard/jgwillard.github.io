1. The source IP address is 192.168.4.27 and its port number is 60268
2. The destination IP address is 128.119.245.12 and its port number is 80
3. --
4. The relative sequence number of the initial TCP segment is 0. The raw sequence number is 378842094. It is identified as a SYN segment because the SYN flag is set.
5. The relative sequence number of the second TCP segment is 0. The raw sequence number is 1147676677. The raw acknowledgment number is 378842094; that is the last received segment's sequence number + 1. It is identified as a SYNACK segment because the SYN and ACK flags are both set.
6. The sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command is 1 (378842095).
7. (Relative) sequence numbers for the first six segments in the TCP connection were: 1, 714, 2162, 3610, 5058, 6506. The times at which those segments were sent were: 3.042440, 3.042623, 3.042623, 3.042624, 3.042625, 3.042626. The times at which those segments were acknowledged were: 3.044654, 3.070550, 3.070556, 3.070557, 3.070557 (cumulative acknowledgment of relative sequence 10850). The RTT values (acknowledgment time - sent time) for each segment were: 0.002214, 0.027927, 0.027933, 0.027933, 0.027932, 0.027931. The running `EstimatedRTT` for each segment (assuming `EstimatedRTT` = measured RTT for the first segment) is given by the formula `EstimatedRTT` = (1 - alpha) * `EstimatedRTT` + alpha * SampleRTT, where the recommended value for alpha is 1/8 = 0.125. That yields a running `EstimatedRTT` of: 0.002214, 0.005428, 0.008241, 0.010702, 0.012856, 0.014740.
8. The lengths of each of the first six TCP segments were: 713, 1448, 1448, 1448, 1448, 1448.
