A rancorous scar crossed his face: an ashen, almost perfect arc that wrinkled his temple on one side and his cheekbone on the other. His real name doesn't matter; everyone in Tacuarembó called him the Englishman of _La Colorada_. The owner of those grounds, Cardoso, didn't want to sell; I heard that the Englishman resorted to an unforeseeable argument: he confided in him the scar's secret history. The Englishman came from the borderlands, from Río Grande del Sur; more than a few said that in Brazil he had been a smuggler. The grounds were swollen, the water supplies bitter; the Englishman, to correct those deficiencies, labored alongside his workers. They say he was severe to the point of cruelty, but scrupulously fair. They also say he was a drinker; a couple times a year he would lock himself in the room of the [mirador] and emerge two or three days later as if from a battle or a frenzy, pale, tremulous, startled and as authoritarian as before. I remember the glacial eyes, the energetic thinness, the gray moustache. He didn't see anyone; it's true that his Spanish was rudimentary, Brazilianized. Other than some business letters or brochures, he didn't receive any correspondence.

The last time I revisited the departments of the North, a flooding of the Caraguatá arroyo forced me to spend the night in _La Colorada_. After a few minutes I thought I noticed that my appearance was inopportune; I tried to ingratiate myself with the Englishman; I appealed to the least perspicacious of passions: patriotism. I said that a country with the spirit of England was invincible. My interlocutor agreed, but added with a smile that he wasn't English. He was Irish, from Dungarvan. Having said that he stopped, as though he had revealed a secret.

We went out, after eating, to look at the sky. It had cleared, but behind the hills of the South, cracked and streaked by lightning, lurked another storm. In the dilapidated, vacant dining room, the worker who had served dinner brought out a bottle of rum. We drank for a long time, in silence.

I don't know what time it would have been when I noticed I was drunk; I don't know what inspiration or what exultation or what boredom made me mention the scar. The face of the Englishman changed; for a few seconds I though he would throw me out of the house. Finally he said to me in his habitual voice:

"I'll tell you the story of my wound under one condition: that you spare no opprobrium, assuage no circumstance of infamy."

I agreed. This is the story he told me, alternating between English and Spanish, and even Portuguese:

"Around 1922, in one of the cities of Connaught, I was one of the many who conspired for the independence of Ireland. Of my companions, some survive dedicating themselves to peaceful works; others, paradoxically, fight on the seas or in the desert, under English colors; another, the worthiest, died in a barracks yard, at dawn, shot by sleepy men; others (not the least fortunate) met their fate in the anonymous and almost secret battles of the civil war. We were republicans, catholics; we were, I suspect, romantics. Ireland wasn't only for us the utopian future and the intolerable present; it was a bitter and warm-hearted mythology, it was the circular towers and red marshes, it was the repudiation of Parnell and the enormous epopees that sing of the theft of bulls that in another incarnation were heroes and in other fish and mountains... One evening I won't forget, an associate from Munster came to us: one John Vincent Moon.

"He was barely twenty years old. He was skinny and flabby at the same time; he gave the awkward impression of being an invertebrate. He had studied with fervor and vanity almost every page of I don't know what communist manual; he used dialectical materialism to shut down any debate. The reasons a man might have to abhor another man or to love him are infinite: Moon reduced world history to a sordid economic conflict. He asserted that the revolution is destined to triumph. I told him that only lost causes can interest a gentleman... It was night; we continued disagreeing in the corridor, in the stairwell, later in the dark streets. The judgments issued by Moon impressed me less than his tone of complete and final certainty. The new comrade didn't debate; he pronounced with disdain and a certain anger.
