A rancorous scar crossed his face: an ashen, almost perfect arc that wrinkled his temple on one side and his cheekbone on the other. His real name doesn't matter; everyone in Tacuarembó called him the Englishman of _La Colorada_. The owner of those grounds, Cardoso, didn't want to sell; I heard that the Englishman resorted to an unforeseeable argument: he confided in him the scar's secret history. The Englishman came from the borderlands, from Río Grande del Sur; more than a few said that in Brazil he had been a smuggler. The grounds were swollen, the water supplies bitter; the Englishman, to correct those deficiencies, worked alongside his grunts [peones]. They say he was severe to the point of cruelty, but scrupulously fair. They also say he was a drinker; a couple times a year he would lock himself in the room of the [mirador] and emerge two or three days later as if from a battle or a frenzy, pale, tremulous, startled and as authoritarian as before. I remember the glacial eyes, the energetic thinness, the gray moustache. He didn't see anyone; it's true that his Spanish was rudimentary, Brazilianized. Other than some business letters or brochures, he didn't receive any correspondence.

The last time I revisited the departments of the North, a flooding of the Caraguatá arroyo forced me to spend the night in _La Colorada_. After a few minutes I thought I noticed that my appearance was inopportune; I tried to ingratiate myself with the Englishman; I appealed to the least perspicacious of passions: patriotism. I said that a country with the spirit of England was invincible. My interlocutor agreed, but added with a smile that he wasn't English. He was Irish, from Dungarvan. Having said that he stopped, as though he had revealed a secret.

We went out, after eating, to look at the sky.
