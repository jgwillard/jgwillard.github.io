How will the evaluation of the following procedures differ under applicative-order evaluation and normal-order evaluation?

```racket
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

(test 0 (p))
```

Under applicative order, the `test` procedure will fail, because the interpreter will attempt to resolve the argument `(p)`, which is circular, before applying the procedure. Under normal order, `(p)` would never be evaluated, because the interpreter will first expand the definitions and only evaluate arguments when needed:

```racket
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if #t 0 (p))
0
```
