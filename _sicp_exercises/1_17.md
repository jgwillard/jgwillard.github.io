One way to implement multiplication is by means of repeated addition, just as exponentiation can be done via repeated multiplication. The following procedure is analogous to the `fast-expt` procedure from [1.16]({{site.url}}/writings/sicp_exercises/1-16). It uses the fact that $$a * b = 2 * (a * (b/2))$$ if $$b$$ is even to do multiplication in a logarithmic number of steps:

```scheme
(define (halve x)
  (/ x 2))

(define (double x)
  (+ x x))

(define (fast-multiply a b)
  (cond ((= b 0)
         0)
        ((even? b)
         (double (fast-multiply a (halve b))))
        (else
         (+ a (fast-multiply a (- b 1))))))
```
