What is the difference between the special-form `if` procedure that is provided, and this `new-if`, defined in terms of `cond`:

```racket
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

In some cases, `new-if` works the same as `if`:

```racket
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

What happens when we use `new-if` in the following `sqrt-iter` procedure?

```racket
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (* guess guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```

`if` is a special form that evaluates the consequent or the alternate expressions, but not both. `new-if`, on the other hand, is a regular procedure and is thus evaluated in applicative order. In this case `new-if` will attempt to call `sqrt-iter` recursively even in the base case, resulting in an infinite recursion.
