Write a procedure that computes elements of [Pascalâ€™s triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) by means of a recursive process.

The procedure will return the mth element of the nth row given that $$0 <= m <= n$$.

The outer elements of a row will always be $$1$$ (therefore the first and second row will also contain exclusively $$1$$). In all other cases, element m of row n will be the sum of mth and (m - 1)th coefficients of previous row. For example, the third element of the fourth row is the sum of the second and third elements of the third row: $$1 + 2 = 3$$. This suggests a recursive implementation:

```racket
(define (f m n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 1) ; first row
        ((= n 1) 1) ; second row
        ((= m 0) 1) ; left-most element
        ((= m n) 1) ; right-most element
        (else (+ (f m (dec n)) (f (dec m) (dec n))))))
```

In fact, the first two cases are redundant, and the above procedure can be simplified by removing them:

```racket
(define (f m n)
  (cond ((= m 0) 1)
        ((= m n) 1)
        (else (+ (f m (dec n)) (f (dec m) (dec n))))))
```

(Note that there is no error handling; the constraint $$0 <= m <= n$$ must be followed).

The following applications of the procedure compute the elements of the seventh row:

```racket
(f 0 7)
1
(f 1 7)
7
(f 2 7)
21
(f 3 7)
35
(f 4 7)
35
(f 5 7)
21
(f 6 7)
7
(f 7 7)
1
```
