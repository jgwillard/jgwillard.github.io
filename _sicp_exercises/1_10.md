The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.

```racket
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```racket
(A 1 10)
1024

(A 2 4)
65536

(A 3 3)
65536
```

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```racket
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive integer values of $$n$$. For example, `(k n)` computes $$5n^2$$.

`f` computes $$2n$$:

```racket
(f 0)
0

(f 2)
4

(f -342)
-684
```

`g` computes $$2^n$$:

```racket
(g 0)
0

(g 1)
2

(g 2)
4

(g 3)
8

(g 4)
16
```

`h` computes $${^{n}2}$$ ([tetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration)):

```racket
(h 0)
0

(h 1)
2

(h 2)
4 ; = 2^2

(h 3)
16 ; = 2^2^2

(h 4)
65536 ; = 2^2^2^2
```

Here is a general implementation of the tetrate function such that `(h n) == (tetrate 2 n)`:

```racket
(define (tetrate a n)
  (cond ((= 0 n) 0)
        ((= 1 n) a)
        (else (expt a (tetrate a (- n 1))))))
```

This implementation accepts the base $$a$$ as a parameter, in addition to the height $$n$$.
