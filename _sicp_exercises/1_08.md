If $$y$$ is an approximmation to the cube root of $$x$$, then a better approximation is given by the following expression:

$$
{x/y^2 + 2y\over3}.
$$

This formula can be used to implement a `cbrt` procedure analogous to the `sqrt` procedure implemented in the previous two exercises. The helper function `good-enough?` remains the same, but the `improve` function is now the above formula rewritten into prefix notation:

```racket
(define (improve y x)
  (/
   (+
    (/ x (* y y))
    (* 2 y))
   3))
```

The other procedures are the same with the exception of some name changes:

```racket
(define (cbrt-iter current-guess last-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? current-guess last-guess)
      current-guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve current-guess x)
                 current-guess
                 x)))

(define (good-enough? current-guess last-guess)
  (<
   (/
    (abs (- current-guess last-guess))
    current-guess)
   0.001))

(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 1.0 2.0 x))
```
