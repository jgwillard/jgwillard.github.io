Describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```racket
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

Note that the `if` procedure will itself return a procedure: either `+` or `-`. So, if `b` is greater than 0, the procedure evaluated will be:

```racket
(+ a b)
```

resulting in a positive number, whereas if `b` is less than 0 (i.e. negative), the procedure evaluated will be:

```racket
(- a b)
```

also resulting in a positive number.
