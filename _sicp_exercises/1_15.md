The following procedures use the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin x = 3 \sin \frac{x}{3} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{x}{3}
$$

to approximate the function $$\sin x$$:

```racket
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

When `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated, `p` is applied five times:

```racket
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine (/ 12.15 3.0)))
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine (/ 4.05 3.0))))
(p (p (sine 1.3499999999999999)))
(p (p (p (sine (/ 1.3499999999999999 3.0)))))
(p (p (p (sine 0.44999999999999996))))
(p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.44999999999999996 3.0))))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.15 3.0)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.049999999999999996))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.049999999999999996)))))
(p (p (p (p 0.1495))))
(p (p (p 0.4351345505)))
(p (p 0.9758465331678772))
(p -0.7895631144708228)
-0.39980345741334
```

We can see from the above application that the space and time used when evaluating `(sine a)` is a function of the number of times `a` must be divided by 3 before we reach the base case where $$abs(a) < 0.1$$. So in order for there to be another division of `a`, `a` must triple in size. Because `a` must increase muliplicatively to get an additive increase in complexity, the order of growth is $$O(\log a)$$.
